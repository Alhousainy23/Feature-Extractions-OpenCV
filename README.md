# Feature Extraction and Features Matching by using Opencv
1. **Used Some Algorithms For Features Extractions**
   * **Harris Corner detection**
   * **Features From Accelerated Segment Test (Fast corner detection algorithm)**
2. **Used Some Algorithms For Feature Extraction and Features Matchers ( by using descriptors)**
   * **Used LOG & DOG WIth --> SIFT Algorithm  (Scale Invariant Feature Transform)**
   * **ORB  (Oriented fast and Related BRIF)**
   * **HOG  Histogram Of Oriented Gradients**
   * **Detect Pedestrians in video using HOG**
   * **local binary pattern - LBP**
   * **Feature matching by using KD-tree - neighbors search**
   * **Brute-Force matcher and FLANN Matcher**
